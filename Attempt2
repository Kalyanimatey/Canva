            <h2>Chair’s Note</h2>
            <p><strong>A Message from the IEEE North Jersey Section Chair, Dr. Emad Farag</strong></p>
            <p>At the start of the New Year, I wish everyone had a relaxing and joyful end-of-the-year Christmas holiday season and hope that you are energized and ready to begin the New Year. I am excited to start my term as Chair of the IEEE North Jersey Section, beginning January 1, 2025. It is truly an honor and a pleasure to serve in this role...</p>
            <p>My vision for the New Year is fourfold: First, to meaningfully impact the local community and the Section’s members; second, to foster the next generation of engineering leaders; third, to preserve the history of technological innovation; and finally, to create an environment of inclusivity and diversity...</p>
            <p>As we move into the New Year, let’s continue to make the IEEE North Jersey Section a force for positive change in our region and local community. Together, we can build an entity that has a lasting, positive impact on society by creating a technical forum for discussion among industry, academia, and government to enhance technology in our community...</p>

            <h2>The Leadership Style of Thomas Edison</h2>
            <p><strong>An article by Harry Roman</strong></p>
            <p>Thomas Edison, the great inventor excelled in his leadership of his project teams. Here is a listing of those special skills he deployed for his R&D lab/invention factory professionals who created his new products and services...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Championed team-based problem-solving, encouraging cross-pollination with other teams [usually 30-40 teams at once were led by Edison].</li>
                <li>Instituted flexible work hours-the R&D lab was open 24/7/365.</li>
                <li>Provided access to all the tools and materials for inventing right there in the invention lab storeroom-facilitating one-stop shopping. He facilitated invention without delays.</li>
                <li>Kept track of project costs with all storeroom material requests being billed back to the project teams doing the requesting.</li>
                <li>Maintained a large corporate library of technical books, journals, and published papers for reference material available to all teams [experts believe Edison started the corporate library movement].</li>
                <li>Encouraged the keeping of detailed notebooks and documentation of project activities [4,000 ledgers completed during his lifetime along with millions of additional project documents generated].</li>
                <li>Allowed teams to visit outside sites where relevant information could be gathered from private experiments and development efforts.</li>
                <li>Edison refrained from closely managing each team on a regular basis, but sometimes he worked side-by-side with them if a difficult problem was encountered and his expertise was requested. He strongly believed in each team learning on its own. Building effective project teams was a source of great pride for Edison. His teams were often multi-disciplinary in nature, employing head and hands thinkers/doers.</li>
